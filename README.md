# Personal Portfolio Site

This is the first full react app I created on my own. Though I have done tutorials and created parts of other apps, this was the first full site created on my own withought tutorials etc.

While react is a bit overkill for a personal portfolio website, it was a great way to learn components, react router, and improve my css skills. I was able to get good practice with compnents and allow them to work dynamically with the projects page in order to add, remove, and rearrange projects.
